# About

### Introduction
Hey there! Welcome to my Portfolio Website open-source code. I'm Ndaru, a UI/UX Designer currently majoring in Computer Science. Here in this website, I'll be showcasing some of my works from previous projects and also showcase some other cool stuff.

### Background
Since this is a portfolio web and all my content are for public viewing, I figure the website itself should also be publicly available to showcase what I've learnt in university, knowing that I majored in Computer Science. I want to make my portfolio website fully hand-coded instead of using a drag-and-drop web development tool so that I could have a feel of what coding a website will feel like. This way, when I create a design, I could measure the feasibility of the implementation. Overall, this practice has helped me create design without having to revise because of "Implementation Issue".

### Why Next.JS?
Nearly all of my web development friend are using Next.JS to develop their website, and I also want to try it out. Other than that, I just feel other frameworks are overrated such as React, Vue, Angular, and also I'm kind of bored using the ones I've used in uni such as Django, Springboot, and I wanted to try something new. Not that it really matters since I'm not going after a developer job position.

# Default Document from Next.JS Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
